    question: 'Can I cut on my granite or quartz countertop?',
    answer: [
      {
        one: 'Exercise caution: Granite countertops, being harder than knife blades, can swiftly dull them. Opt for a wooden cutting board to preserve the sharpness of your knives.',
        two: "While quartz countertops boast exceptional durability, it's advisable to consistently use a cutting board. Despite their robustness, the resin content in quartz renders it slightly softer than natural stone.",

    question: 'Can my granite or quartz countertop be damaged?',
    answer: [
      {
        one: 'Granite is a very durable stone. It is much harder than marble. Granite has been used in the past in the commercial industry and will withstand almost any element it comes up against including cold and heat.  High impact blows can harm granite just like any other solid surface. Because of its crystalline structure, granite can chip if subjected to sharp hard objects. A chip can be filled with a granite dust and epoxy mixture. Granite that is not sealed properly may absorb stains such as oils, which may cause dark spots or discoloration.  Heat from pots and pans or burning liquids will not harm granite under normal conditions.',

    question: 'Why are granite countertops seamed?',
    answer: [
      {
        one: 'Seams are avoided as much as possible but because granite is mined from a quarry in blocks usually no more than 10′ long, they are often necessary. The visibility of seams depends on the granularity, color and pattern in the granite. Where possible, Custom Granite Works prefers to place seams at the center of cooktops or sinks. This creates a 3” seam rather than a full depth seam.',

    question: 'How do I clean my countertops?',
    answer: [
      {
        one: 'Granite is sealed before it is installed.  This will ensure lasting life and beauty.  Granite may be cleaned with a mild phosphate-free, biodegradable liquid dish soap, soap flakes or powder, which contains aromatics.  Granite should always be cleaned and sealed with cleaning products specifically designed for natural stone.',

  {
    question: 'Can hot pots be put directly on the granite surface?',
    answer: [
      {
        one: 'Yes, granite is extremely heat resistant and cookware can be put directly on the surface without damage. You can’t burn granite with ordinary use. Granite conducts heat and is widely used for open flame baking and barbecuing.',
